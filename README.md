# PhD-Prototype

The Prototype I build REALLY quickly for my PhD.
The prototype works like a compass but instead of pointing North, it points to friends.
Technically it points to other people using the app, but eh that sounds dull.

All three versions of the prototype are included, each one a different commit because why not? I was busy don't judge.

##Huh?
*How do I build this?*

It is an iOS project, you need Xcode to build it.

*What does it run on?*

It should run on any iOS 7 or above device.

*Tim, did you leave PubNub credentials in there?!*

Yep, for a temporary account I made and have since forgotten the password for.

*You used PubNub incorrectly*

Probably I was still learning how to use it at the time
