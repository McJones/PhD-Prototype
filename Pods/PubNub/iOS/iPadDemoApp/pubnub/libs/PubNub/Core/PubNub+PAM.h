/**
 Grant \a 'read' access right on \a 'application' access level which will be valid for specified amount of time.

 @code
 @endcode
 \b Example:

 @code
 [PubNub setupWithConfiguration:[PNConfiguration configurationForOrigin:@"pubsub.pubnub.com" publishKey:@"demo"
                                                           subscribeKey:@"demo" secretKey:@"my-secret-key"]
                    andDelegate:self];
 [PubNub connect];
 [PubNub grantReadAccessRightForApplicationAtPeriod:10];
 [PubNub grantWriteAccessRightForChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"] forPeriod:10];
 @endcode

 Code above configure access rights in a way, which won't allow message posting to any channels except \a 'iosdev'
 channel for which \a 'write' access rights has been granted for \b 10 minutes. But despite the fact that channel
 configured only for \a 'write' access rights, because of upper-layer configuration,
 \b PubNub client allowed to subscribe on \a 'iosdev' channel.

 And handle it with delegates:
 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didChangeAccessRights:(PNAccessRightsCollection *)accessRightsCollection {

     // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'application' access level.
 }

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client accessRightsChangeDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {

     // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from application level.
     //
     // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
     // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
     // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
     // has been requested.
 }
 @endcode

 There is also way to observe access rights change process from any place in your application using \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [[PNObservationCenter defaultCenter] addAccessRightsChangeObserver:self withBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'application' access level.
     }
     else {

         // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from application level.
         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
         // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
         // has been requested.
     }
 }];
 @endcode

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidFailNotification.

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @note You can pass a value less than \c 0 as \a 'accessPeriodDuration' argument to use default value (default value is \b 1440 minutes).

 @note When this API is used, it will grant \a 'read' access right and revoke \a 'write' access right for
 \a 'application' access level.

 @warning \a 'application' access level is top-layer of access tree. If any of child access levels (\a 'channel' or
 \a 'user') grant \a 'write' access rights, then \b PubNub client will ignore the fact that top-layer forbid \a 'write'
 access rights and allow to post messages into target channel (for which \a 'write' access right has been granted).

 @param accessPeriodDuration
 Duration in minutes during which \a 'application' access level is granted with \a 'read' access rights.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 \a 'user') grant only one of \a 'read' or \a 'write' access rights, \b PubNub client will ignore them and provide
 abilty to subscribe and post messages into any channels.

 @param accessPeriodDuration
 Duration in minutes during which \a 'application' access level is granted with \a 'read'/ \a 'write' access rights.

 @param handlerBlock
 The block which will be called by \b PubNub client when one of success or error events will be received. The block
 takes two arguments:
 \c collection - \b PNAccessRightsCollection instance which hold set of \b PNAccessRightsInformation instances to
 describe new \a 'application' access rights; \c error - error which describes what exactly went wrong

 \b Example:

                                                           subscribeKey:@"demo" secretKey:@"my-secret-key"]

                    // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.

                else {
 
                    // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'channel' access level.
                    //
                    // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /

                    // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
                    // has been requested.
                }
 }];
 [PubNub grantWriteAccessRightForApplicationAtPeriod:10];
 @endcode

 Code above configure access rights in a way, which won't allow message posting to \a 'iosdev' channel for \b 10 minutes. 
 But despite the fact that \a 'iosdev' channel access rights allow only subscription, \b PubNub client allowed to post
 messages to any channels because of upper-layer configuration (\a 'application' access level allow message posting to any 
 channels for \b 10 minutes).

 And handle it with delegates:
 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didChangeAccessRights:(PNAccessRightsCollection *)accessRightsCollection {

     // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.
 }

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client accessRightsChangeDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {

     // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'channel' access level.
     //
     // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
     // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
     // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
     // has been requested.
 }
 @endcode

 There is also way to observe access rights change process from any place in your application using \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [[PNObservationCenter defaultCenter] addAccessRightsChangeObserver:self withBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.
     }
     else {

         // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'channel' access level.
         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
         // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
         // has been requested.
     }
 }];
 @endcode

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidFailNotification.

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @note You can pass a value less than \c 0 as \a 'accessPeriodDuration' argument to use default value (default value is \b 1440 minutes).

 @note When this API is used, it will grant \a 'read' access right and revoke \a 'write' access right for
 \a 'channel' access level.

 @warning \a 'channel' access level is mid-layer of access tree. If \a 'user' access level grant \a 'write' access rights, 
 then \b PubNub client will ignore the fact that mid-layer forbid \a 'write' access right and allow specific user (which has been granted 
 with \a 'write' access right) to post messages into target channel (for which \a 'write' access right has been granted).
 
 @param channel
 \b PNChannel instance for which \b PubNub client should change access rights to \a 'read'.

 @param accessPeriodDuration
 Duration in minutes during which \a 'channel' access level is granted with \a 'read' access rights.
 
 @param handlerBlock
 The block which will be called by \b PubNub client when one of success or error events will be received. The block takes two arguments:
 \c collection - \b PNAccessRightsCollection instance which hold set of \b PNAccessRightsInformation instances to
 describe new \a 'channel' access rights; \c error - error which describes what exactly went wrong
 during access rights change. Always check \a error.code to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file
 and use \a -localizedDescription / \a -localizedFailureReason and \a -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 then \b PubNub client will ignore the fact that mid-layer forbid \a 'write' access right and allow specific user (which has been granted 
 with \a 'write' access right) to post messages into target channel (for which \a 'write' access right has been granted).
 
 @param channels
 List of \b PNChannel instances for which \b PubNub client should change access rights to \a 'read'.

 @param accessPeriodDuration
 Duration in minutes during which \a 'channel' access level is granted with \a 'read' access rights.

 Grant \a 'write' access right on \a 'channel' access level which will be valid for specified amount of time for specific set of channels.

 @code
 @endcode
 \b Example:

 @code
 [PubNub setupWithConfiguration:[PNConfiguration configurationForOrigin:@"pubsub.pubnub.com" publishKey:@"demo"
                                                           subscribeKey:@"demo" secretKey:@"my-secret-key"]
                    andDelegate:self];
 [PubNub connect];
 [PubNub grantWriteAccessRightForChannels:[PNChannel channelsWithNames:@[@"iosdev", @"androiddev", @"macosdev"]] forPeriod:10];
 [PubNub grantReadAccessRightForApplicationAtPeriod:10];
 @endcode

 Code above configure access rights in a way, which won't allow subscription to \a 'iosdev', \a 'androiddev' and \a 'macosdev' channels
 for \b 10 minutes. But despite the fact that\a 'iosdev', \a 'androiddev' and \a 'macosdev' channels access rights
 allow only message posting, \b PubNub client allowed to post subscribe to any channels because of upper-layer configuration (\a 'application' access level allow subscription
 to any channels for \b 10 minutes).

 And handle it with delegates:
 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didChangeAccessRights:(PNAccessRightsCollection *)accessRightsCollection {

     // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.
 }

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client accessRightsChangeDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {

     // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'channel' access level.
     //
     // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
     // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
     // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
     // has been requested.
 }
 @endcode

 There is also way to observe access rights change process from any place in your application using \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [[PNObservationCenter defaultCenter] addAccessRightsChangeObserver:self withBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully changed access rights for 'channel' access level.
     }
     else {

         // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from 'channel' access level.
         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
         // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which change
         // has been requested.
     }
 }];
 @endcode

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidFailNotification.

 @note To be able use this API, you should provide \a 'secret' key which is used for signature generation.

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @note You can pass a value less than \c 0 as \a 'accessPeriodDuration' argument to use default value (default value is \b 1440 minutes).

 @note When this API is used, it will grant \a 'write' access right and revoke \a 'read' access right for
 \a 'channel' access level.

 @warning \a 'channel' access level is mid-layer of access tree. If \a 'user' access level grant \a 'read' access rights,
 then \b PubNub client will ignore the fact that mid-layer forbid \a 'read' access right and allow specific user (which has been granted
 with \a 'read' access right) to subscribe on target channel (for which \a 'read' access right has been granted).

/**
 Revoke all access rights on whole \a 'channel' level.

 @code
 @endcode
 This method extends \a +revokeAccessRightsForChannel: and allow to specify access rights change handler block.

 @code
 @endcode
 \b Example:

 @code
 [PubNub setConfiguration:[PNConfiguration defaultConfiguration] andDelegate:self];
 [PubNub connect];
 [PubNub grantAllAccessRightsForChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"] forPeriod:10 client:@"admin"];
 [PubNub revokeAccessRightsForChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"] withCompletionHandlingBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully revoked all access rights from channel level.
     }
     else {

         // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from channel level.
         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
         // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which revoke has been requested.
     }
 }];
 @endcode

 Despite the fact that all access rights has been revoked on \a 'channel' level in code above,
 \b PubNub client will be able to subscribe and post into \a "iosdev" channel for \b 10 minutes from the client which
 use \a "admin" authorization key.

 And handle it with delegates:
 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didChangeAccessRights:(PNAccessRightsCollection *)accessRightsCollection {

     // PubNub client successfully revoked all access rights from channel level.
 }

 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client accessRightsChangeDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {

     // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from channel level.
     //
     // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
     // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
     // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which revoke has been requested.
 }

 There is also way to observe revoke process from any place in your application using \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [[PNObservationCenter defaultCenter] addAccessRightsChangeObserver:self withBlock:^(PNAccessRightsCollection *collection, PNError *error) {

     if (error == nil) {

         // PubNub client successfully revoked all access rights from channel level.
     }
     else {

         // PubNub client did fail to revoke access rights from channel level.
         //
         // Always check 'error.code' to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use -localizedDescription /
         // -localizedFailureReason and -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
         // 'error.associatedObject' contains PNAccessRightOptions instance which describes access level for which revoke has been requested.
     }
 }];

 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientAccessRightsChangeDidFailNotification.

 @param channel
 \b PNChannel instance from which \b PubNub client should revoke all access rights.

 @param handlerBlock

 takes two arguments:
 \c collection - \b PNAccessRightsCollection instance which hold set of \b PNAccessRightsInformation instances to

 during access rights revoke. Always check \a error.code to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file
 and use \a -localizedDescription / \a -localizedFailureReason and \a -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).

 @note Make sure that you enabled "Access Manager" on https://admin.pubnub.com.

 @warning As soon as "Access Manager" will be enabled, all \b PubNub clients won't be able to subscribe / publish to

 It happens because channel access rights has higher priority against user based access rights.
