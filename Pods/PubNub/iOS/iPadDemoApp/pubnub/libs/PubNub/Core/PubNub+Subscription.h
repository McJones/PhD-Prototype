 The block which will be called by PubNub client as soon as subscription process state will change. The block takes three arguments:
 \c state - is \b PNSubscriptionProcessState enumerator field which describes current subscription state; \c channels - array of channels for which
 subscription process changed state; \c error - error because of which subscription failed. Always check \a error.code to find out what caused
 error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use \a -localizedDescription / \a -localizedFailureReason and \a -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get
 human readable description for error).
 
 @note You can delete previously configured key from state by passing [NSNull null] as value for target key and \b
 PubNub service will remove specified key from client's state at specified channel.
 
 @warning Client state should be represented with dictionary with channel names as keys and channel state as values. Channel state shouldn't contain any nesting and values should be one of: int, float or string. As keys should be used \b only channel names on which you are subscribing or already subscribed.
 
 @warning If you already subscribed on channel (for which already specified state) and will subscribe to another
 one, it will override old state (if keys are the same or will add new keys into old one).

 (check \b PNErrorCodes header file and use \a -localizedDescription / \a -localizedFailureReason and \a -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human
 readable description for error).
 
 @note You can delete previously configured key from state by passing [NSNull null] as value for target key and \b
 PubNub service will remove specified key from client's state at specified channel.
 
 @warning Client state shouldn't contain any nesting and values should be one of: int, float or string.
 
 @warning If you already subscribed on channel (for which already specified state) and will subscribe to another
 one, it will override old state (if keys are the same or will add new keys into old one).

/**
 Unsubscribe client from set of channels. By default this method will trigger presence event by sending \a 'leave' presence event to channels on
 which client already subscribed and then re-subscribe generating \a 'join' presence event on the rest of channels.
 
 @code
 @endcode
 This method extends \a -unsubscribeFromChannels: and allow to specify unsubscription process state change handler block.
 
 @code
 @endcode
 \b Example:
 
 @code
 PubNub *pubNub = [PubNub clientWithConfiguration:[PNConfiguration defaultConfiguration] andDelegate:self];
 [pubNub connect];
 [pubNub subscribeFromChannel:[PNChannel channelsWithName:@"iosdev"]];
 [pubNub sendMessage:@"PubNub welcomes iOS developers" toChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"]];
 [pubNub unsubscribeFromChannels:[PNChannel channelsWithNames:@[@"iosdev", @"macosdev"]]
 withCompletionHandlingBlock:^(NSArray *channels, PNError *error) {
 
     if (error == nil) {
     
         // PubNub client successfully unsubscribed from specified channels
     }
     else {
     
         // PubNub did fail to unsubscribed from specified channels and reason can be found in error instance
     }
 }];
 @endcode
 
 And handle it with delegates:
 @code
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client didUnsubscribeOnChannels:(NSArray *)channels {
 
     // PubNub client successfully unsubscribed from specified set of channels.
 }
 
 - (void)pubnubClient:(PubNub *)client unsubscriptionDidFailWithError:(PNError *)error {
 
     // PubNub client did fail to unsubscribe from provided set of channels (they are in 'error.associatedObject') of 'error'.
 }
 @endcode
 
 There is also way to observe unsubscription process state from any place in your application using  \b PNObservationCenter:
 @code
 [pubNub.observationCenter addClientChannelUnsubscriptionObserver:self
 withCallbackBlock:^(NSArray *channels, PNError *error) {
 
     if (error == nil) {
     
         // PubNub client successfully unsubscribed from specified channels
     }
     else {
     
         // PubNub did fail to unsubscribed from specified channels and reason can be found in error instance
     }
 }];
 @endcode
 
 Also observation can be done using \b NSNotificationCenter to observe this notifications: kPNClientUnsubscriptionDidCompleteNotification,
 kPNClientUnsubscriptionDidFailNotification.
 
 @param channels
 Array of \b PNChannel instances from which client should unsubscribe.
 
 @param handlerBlock
 The block which will be called by PubNub client as soon as unsubscription process state will change. The block takes two arguments:
 \c channels - array of \b PNChannel instances from which client unsubscribe; \c error - error because of which unsubscription failed.
 Always check \a error.code to find out what caused error (check PNErrorCodes header file and use \a -localizedDescription /
 \a -localizedFailureReason and \a -localizedRecoverySuggestion to get human readable description for error).
