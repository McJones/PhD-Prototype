 [PubNub subscribeOnChannels:[PNChannel channelsWithNames:@[@"iosdev", @"macdev"]]];
 [PubNub sendMessage:@"PubNub welcomes iOS developers" toChannel:[PNChannel channelWithName:@"iosdev"]];

 Code above will be executed in same order as it called. In case of network issues all requests will be terminated with error.

 @note Library designed to support \b procedural coding style, so you can easily subscribe set of commands and they will be issued
